## Harm Reduction

-   Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration
    
    -   Evicenced-based approach to egaging with people who use drugs
    -   Equipping PWUD with life-saving tools
    -   Incorporates community-driven public health strategies
    
-   Harm Reduction Coalition

    -   Practical stratigies & ideas
    -   Reduce negative consequences associated with drug use
    -   Social justice movement


## Why Measure Harm Reduction Orientation?

## Existing Measures Have Limitations

-   Single ordinal items (Wild et al., 2021)
-   Focused on knowledge of harm reduction organizations (Baker et al., 2020)
-   Single substance focus (Goddard, et al. 2023)
-   Narrow definition of harm reduction (Bonar & Rosenberg, 2010)
-   Single population (Sulzer et al., 2021)
-   Little validity evidence (Hofschulte, 2012)
-   Survey methods (MacCoun, 2013)
-   No one uses them!

## The Process

-   Develop Items

    -   Do participants understand items? (3 Rounds)

-   Refine items

    -   Repeat

-   Collect data (EFA)

    -   Analyze

-   Collect more data (CFA & EFA)

    -   Analyze

-   Collect more data (CFA)

    -   Analyze

## Psychometric Info

```{r}
splithalf1 <- splitHalf(scale1) ; splithalf2 <- splitHalf(scale2)
alpha1 <- psych::alpha(scale1, check.keys = TRUE) ; alpha2 <- psych::alpha(scale2, check.keys = TRUE)
glb1 <- glb.algebraic(cor(scale1, use = "pairwise.complete.obs")) ; glb2 <- glb.algebraic(cor(scale2, use = "pairwise.complete.obs"))

data.frame(Scale = c("Strategies", "Strategies", "Strategies", "Principles", "Principles", "Principles"),
           `Reliability Statistic` = c("Average Split Half", "Alpha", "Greatest Lower Bound",  
                           "Average Split Half", "Alpha", "Greatest Lower Bound"),
           Statistic = c(round(splithalf1$meanr,2),
                         round(alpha1$total$raw_alpha, 2), 
                         round(glb1$glb, 2),
                         round(splithalf2$meanr,2),
                         round(alpha2$total$raw_alpha, 2), 
                         round(glb2$glb, 2))) %>% 
  gt::gt(groupname_col = "Scale") %>% 
  gt::tab_header(title = "Reliability Statistics For Both Scales")

## Next Steps

-   Validity & Reliability Evidence

    -   Relationships with stigma, closeness with people who use drugs, experience with substance use diagnoses

    -   Test-retest reliability
    
    -   Amenability to intervention
    
    -   Measurement invariance
